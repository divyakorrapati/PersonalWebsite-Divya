            <p>Hi I am Divya Korrapati, currently pursuing my masters at University of Nebraska, Omaha in Management Information Systems with Data Analytics as my concentration.</p> 
			<p>I completed my bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering from JNT University, India. After my bachelor’s degree I got an opportunity to work for 1 year at KCP & IS Sugar Industries Ltd to work as a Trainee Electrical Design Engineer through campus placement. With my passion being working as a software professional I gave ISTQB certification exam which also helped me to get a job in Ness Technologies, Hyderabad, India as a Software Automation Test Engineer.
			</p>
			<p> During my tenure at Ness I worked with various automation testing tools and technologies like Selenium Web driver for UI testing using Java and Python, JMeter for performance testing, Appium for mobile app testing and some bug tracking tools like Bug Tracker and JIRA. I worked on a project which is developed as a social networking platform for agriculturists in India in which data plays a vital role. While doing performance testing on the website I had to do some analysis on data at some point of time, at that point I got an interest to master tools and technologies related to data analysis.</p>
			<p>At present my career interest is to see myself as a Data Analyst in one of the top 100 companies. I love that we have so much to do with available data and we can make use of it in one form or the other in day to day businesses. Something unique about myself is I can empathize people, which I feel is the most required skill for any person in any situation.</p>
